WaRR has 2 components:
1) WaRRRecorder, a Chromium-based browser that logs users' clicks and keystrokes
2) WaRRReplayer, a Selenium-based replay tool

Using WaRR

1) Get Chromium source code and replace parts of it with the WaRRRecorder
	1.1) run setUpWaRRRecorder.sh (first time only)
	1.2) run src/build/install-build-deps.sh (first time only)
	1.3) run depot_tools/gclient runhooks --force (first time only)
	1.4) troubleshooting: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxBuildInstructions

2) Build WaRR
	2.1) run buildWaRR.sh

3) Record user actions (run the WaRRRecorder)
	3.1) run src/out/Release/chrome
	3.2) a user's clicks and keystrokes are saved in /home/<username>/WaRRRecordedCommands.warr

4) Replay user actions (run the WaRRReplayer)
	4.1) cd WaRRReplayer
	4.2) ant WaRRReplayer -Dchrome=<path to WaRRRecorder> -Dwarr_file=<path to a warr file containing WaRR actions>
	4.3) Examples 
		4.3.1) ant WaRRReplayer -Dchrome=../src/out/Release/chrome -Dwarr_file=searchForWaRRonGoogle.warr
		4.3.2) ant WaRRReplayer -Dchrome=../src/out/Release/chrome -Dwarr_file=sendEmail.warr
		4.3.1) ant WaRRReplayer -Dchrome=../src/out/Release/chrome -Dwarr_file=dragAndDrop.warr
